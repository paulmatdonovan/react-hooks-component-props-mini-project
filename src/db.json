Most of my friends said it would last only a few months, so I'm glad I could at least stick it out that long.I've come to realise many people have decided, like me, to relocate to Thailand from the West.There are many good and bad things about living in another country. I have been back in Australia for a while now and I suppose it is a good time to reflect on the experience."
